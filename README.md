# Tensorflow-Record-Generator-and-Read
The code has been written in python and it generates tensorflow record from image data and then read
I was working on one of the deeplearning project related to convolutional neural network where I used tensorflow record generator and then read the image for further processing. This code is about the tf record generator and reading that. I've commented some part which can be easily replaced with appropriate coding.
